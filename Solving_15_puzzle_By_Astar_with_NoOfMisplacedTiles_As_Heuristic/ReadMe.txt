The folder contain a ASTAR_Manhattan.java, ASTAR_NoOfMisplaced.java, IDASTAR_Manhattan.java, IDASTAR_Misplaced.java file which is implementation of A* and IDA* Algorithm with Manhattan distance and no of misplaced tiles as heursitics repectvely. Please execute these files by running it on eclipse or anyother IDE. The code will ask a input state of 15 puzzle. please type the state as continous characters with comma
For example your input should be like this 
ip : 2,6,10,3,1,4,7,11,8,5,9,15,12,13,14,0 if the state is 
  2  6  10 3
  1  4  7  11
  8  5  9  15
