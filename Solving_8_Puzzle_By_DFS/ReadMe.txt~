The folder DFS contain a DFS.java file which is implementation of Depth First Search Algorithm. Please execute that file by running it on eclipse or anyother IDE. The code will ask a input state of 8 X 8 puzzle. please type the state as continous characters without any other special characters. 
For example your input should be like this 
ip : 120345678 if the state is 
     1 2 0
     3 4 5
     6 7 8
The code will ouput a sequence of steps from given state to goal state and depth at which goal is found.
This DFS can take a bit loneger time than BFS (usually about 2-3 minuites)

Sample Input :
Give Start State :
123450678
The Path for given sequence is

depth is 16
In DFS for the given output, the goal is reached at a depth of 16.
